# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is the lowest level language in which I've developed a project. I think when you learn the lower level languages, it helps you further your abilities in higher level languages because you understand better how the computer is thinking. There where two primary purposes for building this software. The first was to explore C++ and become more comfortable in lower level syntax. The second was to develop and demonstrate competency with json data, loading, and saving data to a file from C++.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
